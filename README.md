# Rona Zona 
Rona Zona is a Embedded Senior Design Project 
 
# CS179J-Team02
Rona Zona is a Self contained wearable device that keeps unwanted people six feet away. The Rona Zona is the perfect device if you are cautious about contracting person to person illnesses. The device monitors surroundings using Computer Vision. If a potential hazard gets too close, Rona Zona will alert and disinfect the surroundings.
 
# Embedded Components
Rona Zona utilizes several Embedded subsystems in order to perform its many functions. 
 
    Alert System: Contains an alarm buzzer, RGB Belt, and laser to warn surrounding people about the 6 ft safe distance
    Spray System: Sprays and disinfects potential hazards that get with in 6 feet
    Computer Vision: Utilizes a camera to capture live images and analyse them for potential hazards that get too close
    NodeMCU Server: A online server that allows individual systems to be created and connected virtually, allowing for remote construction
